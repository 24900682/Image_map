    <h1>Sri Varadharaja Perumal Temple</h1>
    <hr color="black">

    <p><b>The Sri Varadharaja Perumal Temple is one of the most famous Vaishnavite temples in Kanchipuram,
            Tamil Nadu, dedicated to Lord Varadharaja Perumal, a form of Lord Vishnu. It is one of the 108
            Divya Desams, sacred shrines of Lord Vishnu, and holds great religious significance for followers of the
            Sri Vaishnavism tradition. The temple's history dates back to the Chola dynasty and was further
            expanded during the Vijayanagara dynasty, with notable contributions from rulers like
            Krishnadevaraya.
            <br><br>
            The temple is known for its stunning architecture, featuring a grand five-tiered Rajagopuram and an
            expansive prakaras (outer courtyards). The main deity, Lord Varadharaja Perumal, is enshrined in a
            seated posture, and the temple also houses a shrine for Goddess Lakshmi. The temple complex is renowned
            for its beautiful carvings, including those depicting scenes from the Ramayana and Mahabharata,
            as well as other mythological stories. One of the temple's most notable features is the Varadaraja Perumal
            idol, which is traditionally taken out of the temple once every 40 years for a special ritual known as the
             Kanchipuram Varadaraja Darshan". The temple is also an important center for Vaishnavite rituals and
            festivals, with the Brahmotsavam and Vaikunta Ekadasi being celebrated with great
            enthusiasm.</b></p>
