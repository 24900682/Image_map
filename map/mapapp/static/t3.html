    <h1>Sri Vaikunta Perumal Temple</h1>
    <hr color="black">
    <p><b>The Sri Vaikunta Perumal Temple is a prominent Vaishnavite temple located in Kanchipuram, Tamil
            Nadu. Dedicated to Lord Vishnu, it is one of the 108 Divya Desams, which are the holy abodes of
            Vishnu mentioned in the works of the Alvars (Tamil saints). The temple is famous for its unique
            architecture and rich religious significance, dating back to the Pallava dynasty in the 8th century
            CE.
            <br><br>
            The temple is built in the Dravidian style and features an impressive five-tiered Rajagopuram (gateway
            tower), and a spacious inner sanctum housing the main deity, Vaikunta Perumal, a form of Vishnu. It is
            particularly known for its massive corridors and intricate sculptures, which include depictions of
            various mythological stories and scenes from the life of Lord Vishnu. The temple also houses a beautiful
            central shrine dedicated to Vishnu's consort, Goddess Lakshmi. The Vaikunta Ekadasi festival,
            celebrated here with great fervor, attracts numerous devotees every year, who come to offer prayers and seek
            blessings for prosperity and spiritual growth.</b></p>
