            The Ekambaranathar Temple in Kanchipuram, Tamil Nadu, is one of the most significant temples dedicated to
            Lord Shiva. It is part of the Pancha Bhoota Stalas, representing the element Earth. The temple's history
            dates back to the Pallava dynasty and has been expanded over time by various dynasties, including the Cholas
            and Vijayanagara Empire. The temple complex features a towering five-tiered Rajagopuram, vast courtyards,
            intricately carved halls, and a sacred mango tree believed to be over 3,000 years old, with three varieties
            of mangoes symbolizing the three gunas (Sattva, Rajas, and Tamas).
            <br><br>
            Legend has it that Goddess Parvati once worshipped Lord Shiva under a mango tree here, and Lord Shiva
            appeared as the tree itself to bless her. The temple is known for its grand rituals and festivals, such as
            Shivarathri and Vaikasi Visakam, which draw large crowds. It is a center of spiritual significance and
            architectural beauty, offering a place for both devotion and historical exploration.
